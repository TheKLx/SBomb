# How does this tool work?
This tool "SBomb" is powered via Twilio, that means you have to sign up (if you haven't) to Twilio and put in your Credentials. Basically the script uses the API's from your Twilio account.

# Working on OTP API's
i am currently working on getting 30 OTP API's & modify the script and upload it on here (github).

# When will be the script updated, to use the OTP APi's?
well, in my free time i am gonna work on this but this is gonna be a LONG project.
